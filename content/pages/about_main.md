Hi! I'm Russell.

I'm a microbiologist who uses graph theory and machine learning to study the
relationships that bacteria and archaea form with their host organisms, and
lately [giant viruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_virus) and their
hosts. Or, I'm a computer scientist who builds software that uses concepts from
evolution to extract knowledge about ecology from large datasets. Or, I'm
a data scientist who uses Python to explore biological systems. Or, I'm
a physicist that went rouge and defected to the squishy side of science. Take
your pick.

I am a JSPS fellow at [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/) [Institue
of Chemical Research](https://www.kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jp/) in the [Ogata
Laboratory](https://cls.kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/).

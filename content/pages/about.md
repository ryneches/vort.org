Summary: About Russell Neches

Um, hi! I'm a microbiologist who uses graph theory and machine learning to study the relationships that bacteria and archaea form with their host organisms. Or, I'm a computer scientist who builds software that uses concepts from evolution to extract knowledge about ecology from large datasets. Or, I'm a data scientist who uses Python to explore biological systems. Or, I'm a physicist that went rouge and defected to the squishy side of science. Take your pick.

This is the six reincarnation of _Russell's Blog_, and a return to static content for the first time since my ill-fated efforts to build something useful with Apache's [XSLT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT) plugin. I mostly use it to talk about science-y things and things that I find vexing or amusing.

I love the natural world. I love the engineered world. I love the people who study both of those worlds. However, there are a lot of things about science and engineering that I don't like. I don't like academic publishers that siphon [tens of billions of dollars](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science) out of public research and into the hands of their shareholders. I don't like the system of incentives built on top of academic publishing that punishes researchers for fully disclosing their results, methods and thought process. I don't like the way students are treated in the classroom, on campus and by [the student loan industry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE66HEZBZYE). I don't like the way [women are treated in science](http://sites.nationalacademies.org/shstudy/index.htm). I don't like the way people who don't pass as European [are treated in science](https://qz.com/432756/in-39-years-us-physics-doctorates-went-to-66-black-women-and-22000-white-men/).

Building things and studying the universe is awesome. Everyone should be allowed to play if they want to. I'm here because I think this stuff is fun, but I'm also here because I know it hasn't been fun for a lot of people. I want to help put that right.

Summary: Second day sheltering in palace.

Worked on improving query performance on my database of host-phage
interactions. Tried not to freak out after reading [Ferguson *et
al.*](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf).
Went for a walk by the Oakland embarcadero. The renovated Ferry Terminal
building looks like it's going to be pretty great when it finally opens.
Enjoyed woodworking videos from [Rex Kruger](https://www.rexkrueger.com/) and
[Steve Ramsey](https://woodworkingformeremortals.com/), and cooking videos
from [*My Name is Andong*](https://www.youtube.com/user/antoineshapiro) and
[*Chinese Cooking
Demystified*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC54SLBnD5k5U3Q6N__UjbAw).

Ashanti had lots of Zoom meetings and did lots of management things. I mostly
stared at my code and felt stupid.

It doesn't sound like it was a hard day, but it was.

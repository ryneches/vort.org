Summary: 

Ashanti's company required all employees to work from home yesterday (a new
experience for her). I work at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which
has been advising telework for several days already. We got the news that the
Bay Area was under a Shelter-in-Place order during my group's first
online-only weekly meeting, and I spent the rest of the day shopping for some
last minute supplies.

Camille's qualifying exam was held today from her living room, which she
passed unanimously (of course). Since we can't go out to celebrate, we are
going to have an happy hour on Zoom tomorrow.

I started reading up on [Reverse Transcription Loop-mediated Isothermal
Amplification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Transcription_Loop-mediated_Isothermal_Amplification),
which is being used as the basis for [a real time test for COVID-19 that can
be performed at
home](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028373v1), under
development by New England Biolabs the Wuhan Institute of Virology. I had an
interesting conversation with Emily Tung and Andrey Kislyuk about how the
preprint, and Emily estimated that the reagents and primers would cost about
$1000, though obtaining and handling a sample from a patient with the virus to
serve as a positive control would be reckless. On the other hand, there seems
to be a fairly high likelihood that one or all of us will become infected at
some point. If there is still not a home-based test available, I suppose there
are worse ways to spend two or three weeks in isolation!

Around five o'clock, I was feeling pretty lousy from sitting around the house
all day, and convinced Ashanti to go for a walk around Lake Merritt with me.
About half of the people we saw were running or jogging (normally it's closer
to one in five), so I think it's hard to say if our neighbors are practicing
social distancing or not. We kept our distance and didn't interact with
anyone, but it was nice to see other people. Maybe the city could mark out
some picnic spots with appropriate separation so people can at least see each
other?

I called mum to see how she's doing. Los Angeles is not doing shelter-in-place
yet, though they probably should be. She was the only student at her dojo
today.

We came home and did one of Ashanti's 20 minute exercise videos, which was
deeply unpleasant but effective. Ashanti made dinner, I cleaned up, and we
watched the St. Patrick's Day episode of Bob's Burgers. It was pretty great.

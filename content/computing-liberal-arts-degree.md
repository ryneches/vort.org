Summary: 


I never really fit into any of the various educational programs I've
attended. I've spent a lot of time thinking about what's wrong with
them, because I know, of course, that there isn't anything wrong with
me.

I see five big problems with higher education :

-   We draw too bright a line between "technical" and "non-technical"
    degrees
-   We design courses around departments instead of topics
-   We do a terrible job of integrating hands-on experience
-   We structure courses and evaluations in a strictly linear,
    pipeline-like way
-   We do an criminally bad job of caring for students' mental and
    emotional health

Biology students learn *about* cell culture and PCR, but they rarely
have a chance to actually *do* these things. Computer science students
learn *about* microprocessors, but never *build* one. Engineering and
physics students learn *about* ballistics, but never actually get to
*try* it in any meaningful way. Labs are always almost always
afterthoughts, and connect poorly to the rest of the curriculum.

I would like to see at least a few colleges scrap the idea of
traditional bachelors of science degree, and instead offer a liberal
arts style degree focused on science and technology. I would like to see
them mix in a heavy dose of practical trade-school style instruction.
Get students into machine shops and out into the woods, and let them get
their hands dirty. The spine of every kind of degree should be
structured around history. Only history can lend any sort of coherent
narrative to a big topic. Last of all, there absolutely must be some way
of avoiding the classes-grades-classes-grades treadmill. The hectic
academic schedule of classes and grades promotes toxic mix of
self-loathing and narcissism and severely punishes any sort of
reflection. There are better, easier ways of organizing instruction and
evaluating students.

This is my curriculum for a liberal arts degree in technology and
computing. Someone with this degree would be prepared to begin a masters
degree in an engineering or technical field, but it is not intended to
provide any sort of "workplace" training (although it doesn't discourage
it). It would also serve as a strong base from which to purse a Ph.D. in
a wide variety of topics, and would better prepare students to operate
as independent researchers. In that sense, it's a liberal arts degree,
not a bachelors of science. Personally, I think this would be vastly
superior to any existing undergraduate science or engineering degree,
both for people who go on to pursue advanced degrees and people who do
not. Really successful undergraduates wind up constructing an experience
something like this for themselves. Everyone would be better served if
we simply made it official.

Evaluations would be based on the student's portfolio. Each of the
sixteen classes would be designed around the creation of tangible
artifacts that would go into the portfolio. The quality and imagination
of the artifacts would determine the grade for the unit, and would be
set by a panel of faculty assembled for the review. Faculty reviews of
each portfolio would be archived and made available to the student.
Artifacts may be replaced by the student at any time and the portfolio
resubmitted for evaluation. Graduation occurs upon a positive evaluation
of a complete portfolio.

The curriculum might take a bit longer than four years to complete. I
would address this by offering admission to students around sixteen or
seventeen years old, and select faculty with the necessary skills for
mentoring adolescents. Regardless of age, the admissions process would
include a formal psychological evaluation to establish the emotional
preparedness of the student to engage in the program. I would would also
include mandatory counseling for all students throughout the program;
student who are doing emotionally well would use it as career counseling
and to help them grapple with their intellectual and aesthetic
priorities.

I would also encourage students to take vacations and breaks, and advise
and organize these breaks through the counseling services. For
struggling students, these would be no-fault opportunities to collect
themselves and address personal issues. For others, they would be
opportunities for internships, travel and other projects. Organizing
evaluations around student portfolios would benefit both struggling and
excelling students; breaks in instruction could be used to shore up
specific weak spots, or to create artifacts of superlative quality.

The portfolio structure would also make it less risky to include younger
students. If it is determined that a student is not emotionally prepared
for college, he or she can be placed into an associated high school but
continue attending the program part-time, and then re-join as a full
time student once they graduate from high school. The portfolio
structure would also prevent young students from rushing through the
program without reaching the appropriate level of emotional and
intellectual maturity deemed necessary by the faculty. It would provide
a fair mechanism for the faculty to push precocious students to direct
their efforts at achieving quality rather than speed.

I've also included a few topics and activities that most university
programs would probably deem inappropriate, particularly related to
weapons and warfare. I've done this because I think too many engineers
and scientists fail to truly appreciate the destructive aspects of
technology and do not develop a mature understanding of how their work
is used. There is simply no getting around the fact that much of our
technology is directly connected to the business of fighting and
killing.

To address this, the program would require students to build, use and
study weapons and their uses. This would include using stone tools to
make spears, and then learning how to hunt with them, using basic
metalworking to build simple firearms, and then conducting target
practice on a ballistics range, and building vehicles such as sailboats
and drones and using them to conduct mock battles. The scenarios would
be designed to evoke questions about history and ethics, and the
coursework would include studies on those topics. To make this work, the
faculty would need to include military historians. This is an aspect
that is totally missing from extant engineering and science curricula.
